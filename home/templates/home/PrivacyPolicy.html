            <strong>Privacy Notice</strong>

            <p>

                This Privacy Notice explains how we collect, use and protect any information about you. <br>It also
                tells
                you how to get in touch if you have any questions, which we will be more than happy to answer. <br>

                We offer a range of services related to online car rental, including products and services such as
                insurance, through our own websites, emails and text messages. <br>This Notice applies to all the
                personal
                data we collect while we are doing this, or when you contact us by email, phone or post

            </p>

            <strong> Personal data you give us </strong>

            <p>

                We can not help you make a booking or request a quote without certain information.<br> When you do
                either of
                those things, we ask you for the information we need so we can give you what you want. <br>This is
                standard
                stuff and may include your name, age, date and place of birth and contact details (email, address and
                phone
                number).<br> It can also include information about your passport, identity card and driving license and
                payment information.<br>

                In addition, we collect information from your computer when you use one of our platforms, even if you do
                not
                make a booking.<br> This may include your IP address, which browser you use, and your language settings.<br>
                This is a basic overview of the information we collect.

            </p>

            <strong>Personal data you give us</strong>

            <p>

                We store and use the information that you give us. When you make a booking, we need at least your name,
                email address and payment information.<br> If you get in touch with us (by phone, by email or through
                social
                media, for example) we will collect information from you there too.<br>

                After your booking, we may ask you to provide a review to help us improve our services, and to help
                ensure
                future customers get exactly what they are looking for.<br>

                There are also other ways you might give us information.<br> For example, if you are browsing with your
                mobile device, you can share your current location with us, so we can provide you with the best possible
                service.<br> To make things easier, you can also open a user account, which lets you review and manage
                your
                bookings, as well as saving your personal settings and your passport and driving licence details.<br> It
                also makes it easier to make future bookings.
